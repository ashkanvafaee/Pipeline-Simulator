Differences: 5 instructions (STB, JSR/R, LDW, STW, TRAP) 

STB: 	1. Why would SR2.NEEDED be set? (Only reading from 1 register operand)
	2. ALUK and ALU.RESULTMUX shouldn't be set? (ALU doesn't do address calculation)


JSR/R: 	1. Shouldn't load register be set (for both JSR and JSRR) (writing to R7)


LDW:	1. LSHF (You're right, thanks)


STW:	1. Why would SR2.NEEDED be set? (Only reading from 1 register operand)
	2. LSHF (You're right, thanks)
	3. ALUK and ALU.RESULTMUX shouldn't be set? (ALU doesn't do address calculation)
